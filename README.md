# 42-core

### List fo projects

1. [**libft**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/libft)

   > This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

   - **keywords**: `Makefile` `library` `linked list`
   - **session** of coding: 01.Dec.22 - 13.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 23.Dec.22

1. [**get_next_line**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/get_next_line)

   > May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

   - **keywords**: `static variable` `file descriptor`
   - **session** of coding: 17.Dec.22 - 24.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 06.Jan.23

1. [**ft_printf**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/ft_printf)

   > This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

   - **keywords**: `variadic function` `ctype`
   - **session** of coding: 24.Dec.22 - 31.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 21.Jan.23

1. [**born2beroot**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/born2beroot)

   > This project aims to introduce you to the world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

   - **keywords**: `system administration` `virtual machine`
   - **session** of coding: 21.Jan.23 - 31.Mar.23
   - **complete** in evaluation: 18.Apr.23

1. [**minitalk**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/minitalk)

   > The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

   - **keywords**: `UNIX` `signal` `process`
   - **session** of coding: 31.Dec.22 - 04.May.23
   - **complete** in evaluation: 07.Jun.23

1. [**fractol**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/fractol)

   > Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX. (MLX42 for me)

   - **keywords**: `graphics` `mathematical notation` `complex numbers` `optimization` `event handling`
   - **session** of coding: 28.Apr.23 - 03.Jun.23
   - **complete** in evaluation: 14.Jun.23

1. [**push_swap**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/push_swap)

   > This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

   - **keywords**: `sorting` `algorithms` `implementation` `data structure`
   - **session** of coding: 05.May.23 - 12.Jul.23
   - ~~**complete** in evaluation:~~ ready to submit

1. [**pipex**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/pipex)

   > This project aims to deepen your understanding of the two concepts that you already know: Redirections and Pipes. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

   - **keywords**: `UNIX` `process` `pipe` `folk` `access` `dup2` `execve` `wait` `waitpid`
   - ~~**complete** in evaluation:~~ Forbidden to try (Cuz I'v done the minitalk)
     - Worked on the pipex project to study about the `fork`, `pipe`, `access`, `dup2`, `exec`, `wait`, `waitpid`, prior to working on the minishell project.

### List fo projects

1. [**libft**](./tree/main/libft)
    > This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus. 
    - **keywords**: `Makefile` `library` `linked list`
    - **session** of coding: 01.Dec.22 - 13.Dec.22 
    - **complete** in evaluation: 23.Dec.22 
    
1. [**get_next_line**](./tree/main/get_next_line)

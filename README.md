# 42-core

### List fo projects

1. [**libft**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/libft)

   > This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

   - **keywords**: `Makefile` `library` `linked list`
   - **session** of coding: 01.Dec.22 - 13.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 23.Dec.22

1. [**get_next_line**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/get_next_line)

   > May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

   - **keywords**: `static variable` `file descriptor`
   - **session** of coding: 17.Dec.22 - 24.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 06.Jan.23

1. [**ft_printf**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/ft_printf)

   > This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

   - **keywords**: `variadic function` `ctype`
   - **session** of coding: 24.Dec.22 - 31.Dec.22
   - **complete** in evaluation: 21.Jan.23

1. [**born2beroot**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/born2beroot)

   > This project aims to introduce you to the world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

   - **keywords**: `system administration` `virtual machine`
   - **session** of coding: 21.Jan.23 - 31.Mar.23
   - **complete** in evaluation: 18.Apr.23

1. [**minitalk**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/minitalk)

   > The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

   - **keywords**: `UNIX` `signal` `process`
   - **session** of coding: 31.Dec.22 - 04.May.23
   - **complete** in evaluation: 07.Jun.23

1. [**fractol**](https://github.com/san-ghun/42-core/tree/main/fractol)

   > Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX. (MLX42 for me)

   - **keywords**: `graphics` `mathematical notation` `complex numbers` `optimization` `event handling`
   - **session** of coding: 28.Apr.23 - 03.Jun.23
   - ~**complete** in evaluation:~ ready to submit

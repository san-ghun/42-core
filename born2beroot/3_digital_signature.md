## Digital Signature

If everything work well, close the virtual machine and **do not** touch it anymore!!!!!    
Or the signature will change.

To submit the digital signature, 
- Go to `goinfre` or `sgoinfree` 
- Run `shasum <yourfile>.dvi`
- copy the key to a file with the name `signature.txt` and submit it.

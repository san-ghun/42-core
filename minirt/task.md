    - If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file
        - The program must exit properly
        - Return `"Error\n"` followed by an explicit error message of your choice
    - Error Case
        - unsupported file extension
        - missing extension
        - empty file
        - unable to parse an element in description file
